Welcome to my site! I am currently the Lead Analytics Solutions Architect at St. Jude Childrenâ€™s Research Hospital. I completed my Master of Public Policy and MSc in Applied Statistics at the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. My primary professional experiences involve mathematical analysis in public health, public policy and law. Ultimately, I am most interested in the power of mathematics to analyze and advocate for public policies that benefit the most marginalized among us.
