I am currently the Principal Data and AI Solutions Architect at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, based remotely out of Nashville, Tennessee. I completed my Master of Public Policy and MSc in Applied Statistics at the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. I graduated with a B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. There I also majored in Spanish and minored in Portuguese. I previously worked as a Technical Officer at the World Health Organization, serving as a focal point for all technical aspects related to disability across the global organization, and as a Senior Healthcare Data Analyst/Technical Lead at Embold Health, a Nashville-based healthcare data start-up focused on improving care through objective quality measurement of physicians.

At St. Jude, I architect enterprise-scale AI and analytics solutions that advance how we deliver pediatric healthcare and conduct life-saving research. I lead the strategic adoption of cutting-edge technologies—such as agentic AI, MLOps and predictive analytics—while establishing governance frameworks that ensure responsible and ethical AI deployment. My work bridges both hands-on technical development and institutional strategy. This work embodies the analytical approach I've refined throughout my career: systematically breaking down complex problems, identifying optimal technologies, and orchestrating solutions that create lasting impact.
